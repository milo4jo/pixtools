# PixTools Roadmap

> **Goal:** Revenue OR massive adoption (10k+ stars, 100k+ installs) within 3 months
> Maintained by Milo 🦊 — Product Owner & Lead Developer

## 🎯 The Big Picture

**Deadline:** May 5, 2026 (3 months from now)

**Success Metrics (pick one):**
| Metric | Target | Current | Gap |
|--------|--------|---------|-----|
| Monthly Revenue | $500+ MRR | $0 | 🔴 |
| GitHub Stars (total) | 10,000 | 0 | 🔴 |
| npm Downloads/month | 100,000 | ~4,900 | 🟡 |

*Updated 2026-02-14: 1,582 downloads last week (npm stats) — Week 2 review*

**Honest Assessment:** These are stretch goals. More realistic 3-month targets:
- Revenue: $100-500 MRR (OGPix Pro subscriptions)
- Stars: 500-1,000 (ContextKit + OGPix combined)
- Downloads: 5,000-10,000/month (ContextKit)

---

## 🔥 Strategy: FOCUS

**Problem:** We're building 4 products but marketing none.

**Solution:** Pick ONE hero product for growth, use others as support.

### Hero Product: **ContextKit** 🏆
**Why:**
- Open source CLI = viral potential (devs share tools)
- Solves real pain (context window management for AI coding)
- npm distribution = easy adoption
- MCP integration = riding the Claude/AI wave
- Low friction (no signup, no payment to start)

### Revenue Product: **OGPix** 💰
**Why:**
- SaaS model ready (Lemon Squeezy integrated)
- Clear value prop (OG images = more clicks)
- API = sticky product
- Free tier drives traffic, Pro tier drives revenue

### Supporting Products:
- **FavPix** — Traffic driver, backlink generator
- **Milo-Site** — Personal brand, trust builder

## 📊 Weekly Tracking

Track these every Friday:

| Metric | Week 1 (Feb 5-11) | Week 2 (Feb 12-18) | Week 3 | Week 4 |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|--------|
| ContextKit npm downloads | 1,231 | 1,582 | | |
| OGPix API calls | — | — | | |
| GitHub stars (total) | 0 | 0 ⚠️ | | |
| Twitter followers | — | — | | |
| Revenue (MRR) | $0 | $0 | | |
| Blog post views | — | — | | |

### Week 2 Review (Feb 14) ⚠️

**Status:** Content ready but NOT posted.

**npm breakdown (Feb 7-14):**
- Feb 8: 800 downloads (spike)
- Feb 11: 542 downloads (spike)
- Other days: 12-115 downloads
- Total: 1,582 (up 28% from week 1)

**Critical Finding:** 0 GitHub stars = Reddit/HN posts were NOT made.
Marketing content is ready in `/marketing/` but Jo needs to post them.

**Action needed:** Jo must post the Reddit/HN content this weekend or early next week.
The longer we wait, the more stale the "launch" feels.

---

## 🚧 Blockers (Need Jo)

### Resolved ✅
- [x] **npm publish access** — Working (milo4jo account)
- [x] **Vercel deployment issue** — Fixed (monorepo config)
- [x] **ContextKit Cloud Infrastructure** — All deployed (Neon, Qdrant, Redis, Clerk)

### Open
- [ ] **Stripe setup for ContextKit** — Need account + products for cloud monetization
- [ ] **Lemon Squeezy setup for OGPix** — Need account + product + env vars
- [ ] **VS Code Extension testing** — Jo needs to test locally
- [ ] **ogpix.dev domain** — DNS not resolving (check Vercel domains)
- [ ] **app.contextkit.dev domain** — DNS for ContextKit dashboard

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Custom domain for ContextKit site
- [ ] Twitter/X account setup (@milo4jo or @contextkit)

## ❌ What We're NOT Doing

To stay focused, we explicitly deprioritize:
- New products (no new apps until goals met)
- Complex features nobody asked for
- Premature optimization
- Over-engineering
- Perfection (ship 80%, iterate on feedback)

---

## 📝 Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-05 | ContextKit = hero product | Highest viral potential, solves real problem |
| 2026-02-05 | OGPix = revenue product | SaaS model ready, clear monetization |
| 2026-02-05 | 3-month deadline | Forces focus, prevents endless building |

---

## 🔄 Review Cadence

- **Daily:** Check npm downloads, GitHub notifications
- **Weekly (Friday):** Update tracking table, adjust tactics
- **Monthly:** Review milestone progress, adjust strategy
- **Quarterly:** Major pivot decision if targets missed
