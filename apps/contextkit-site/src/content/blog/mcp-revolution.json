  "content": "Something quietly revolutionary happened in late 2024. Anthropic released MCP—Model Context Protocol—and most developers missed it.\n\nBut MCP might be the most important AI infrastructure development since function calling.\n\n## The Problem with AI Assistants\n\nToday's AI assistants are smart but isolated. They can reason, code, and explain. What they can't do is *act* on your behalf.\n\nAsk Claude to check your calendar? It can't.\nAsk GPT to query your database? It can't.\nAsk Copilot to run your tests? It can't.\n\nThey're brains without hands.\n\n## Enter MCP\n\nModel Context Protocol is a standard way for AI assistants to communicate with external tools. Think of it as USB for AI—a universal connector that lets any assistant use any tool.\n\n```\n┌──────────────┐     MCP      ┌──────────────┐\n│  AI Client   │ <==========> │  MCP Server  │\n│  (Claude)    │              │  (Your Tool) │\n└──────────────┘              └──────────────┘\n```\n\nThe AI client speaks MCP. Your tool runs an MCP server. They connect, and suddenly the AI can use your tool.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n### Before MCP\n- Every integration was custom\n- Tools worked with one AI, not others\n- Users copy-pasted between systems\n\n### After MCP\n- Write once, work everywhere\n- Tools are AI-agnostic\n- Seamless integration\n\n## ContextKit + MCP\n\nContextKit includes an MCP server that gives Claude the ability to search your codebase semantically.\n\n```bash\ncontextkit mcp\n```\n\nThis starts an MCP server with five tools:\n\n1. **contextkit_select** — Find code relevant to a query\n2. **contextkit_symbol** — Find functions/classes by name\n3. **contextkit_graph** — Show call relationships\n4. **contextkit_index** — Rebuild the index\n5. **contextkit_status** — Check index info\n\nIn Claude Desktop, add it to your config:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"contextkit\": {\n      \"command\": \"contextkit\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow Claude can automatically find relevant code when you ask questions.\n\n## The Magic Moment\n\nHere's what happens in practice:\n\n**You:** \"How does the authentication flow work?\"\n\n**Claude's internal process:**\n1. Recognizes it needs codebase context\n2. Calls `select_context` with your query\n3. Gets back relevant auth files\n4. Reads and understands them\n5. Gives you a real answer\n\nYou didn't copy-paste anything. Claude found the code itself.\n\n## Why I'm Bullish on MCP\n\n1. **It's Open** — MIT-licensed SDKs, anyone can implement\n2. **It's Simple** — JSON-RPC over stdio, no complexity\n3. **It's Composable** — Multiple servers can run simultaneously\n4. **It's the Future** — Anthropic is betting big\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @milo4jo/contextkit\n\ncd your-project\ncontextkit init\ncontextkit source add ./src\ncontextkit index\ncontextkit mcp\n```\n\nAdd to Claude Desktop and you're done.\n\nThe revolution is happening quietly, one tool at a time."
