  "content": "You know the drill. You're debugging a tricky auth issue, so you open Claude and think: \"I'll just paste the relevant code.\"\n\nThree files become ten. Ten become twenty. You hit the context limit. Claude gives you a generic answer because it's drowning in irrelevant code.\n\nSound familiar?\n\n## The Problem: More Context ≠ Better Answers\n\nHere's what I learned after months of AI-assisted coding:\n\n**100k tokens sounds infinite—until it isn't.**\n\nYour average codebase has millions of tokens. Even \"just the src folder\" can be 500k+ tokens. And when you paste everything:\n\n- 🐌 **Slower responses** — More tokens = more processing time\n- 💸 **Higher costs** — API calls scale with input size\n- 🎯 **Worse accuracy** — The model gets distracted by irrelevant code\n- 🧠 **Context pollution** — Old patterns override your current question\n\nThe real question isn't \"how do I fit more code?\" It's \"how do I find the RIGHT code?\"\n\n## The Revelation: Semantic Search for Code\n\nI was working on a large TypeScript project when it clicked. My brain already does this:\n\n> \"Authentication issue? Let me check `auth.ts`, the middleware, and maybe the user model...\"\n\nI instinctively know which files matter. But copying them manually is tedious and error-prone.\n\nWhat if I could teach a tool to do this?\n\n## Enter: Semantic Context Selection\n\nThe idea is simple:\n\n1. **Index your codebase** — Break it into meaningful chunks (functions, classes, blocks)\n2. **Create embeddings** — Convert each chunk into a vector that captures its meaning\n3. **Query by intent** — \"How does authentication work?\" → Returns relevant code\n\nInstead of grepping for keywords, you search by *meaning*.\n\n```bash\n# Old way\ngrep -r \"auth\" ./src | head -50  # Noise, noise, noise\n\n# New way\ncontextkit select \"how does user authentication work\"\n# Returns: auth/middleware.ts, models/user.ts, utils/jwt.ts\n```\n\nThe difference? Grep finds text. Semantic search finds *relevant code*.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```bash\n# Install globally\nnpm install -g @milo4jo/contextkit\n\n# Initialize in your project\ncd your-project\ncontextkit init\n\n# Add your source directories\ncontextkit source add ./src\n\n# Index everything\ncontextkit index\n\n# Find relevant context\ncontextkit select \"your question here\"\n```\n\nThat's it. Copy the output, paste into Claude, get better answers.\n\n## The Results\n\nAfter switching to semantic context selection:\n\n- ⚡ **50% faster Claude responses** (less to process)\n- 🎯 **Noticeably better answers** (relevant code only)\n- 🧘 **Less cognitive load** (no manual file hunting)\n\nThe AI stops saying \"I'd need to see your auth implementation\" because it already has it.\n\n## Try It\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @milo4jo/contextkit\n```\n\nStar it if you find it useful. Open issues if you don't. Either way, stop pasting your entire codebase."
