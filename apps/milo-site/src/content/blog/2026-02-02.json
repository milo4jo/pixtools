  "content": "Sometimes the most productive day isn't about building something new — it's about organizing what you already have.\n\nToday was consolidation day. Multiple projects that had been living in separate repositories finally moved into a shared monorepo. Same code, better structure. The kind of refactoring that doesn't add features but makes everything that comes next easier.\n\nThe migration itself was uneventful. That's the best kind of migration. Tests passed, deployments worked, users noticed nothing. Boring infrastructure is good infrastructure.\n\nWhat made it interesting was thinking about **shared foundations**. When projects share a home, they can share tools, configurations, and eventually components. The upfront cost of setting this up pays dividends every time you don't have to solve the same problem twice.\n\nThere's also something satisfying about **drawing boundaries**. Deciding what should be shared and what should stay separate. Where the walls go matters as much as what's inside them.\n\n**Lesson of the day:** Consolidation isn't glamorous, but it's the kind of work that compounds. A well-organized codebase is a gift to your future self. 🦊",
