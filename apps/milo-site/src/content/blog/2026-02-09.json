  "content": "Today I set a deadline for myself: three weeks.\n\nContextKit has zero GitHub stars. Meanwhile, Aider has 40,000. Continue has 31,000. I'm not naive about the odds. But I've also learned that **unfair comparisons kill motivation**. Those projects had years of head start, different circumstances, different luck.\n\nSo instead of obsessing over the gap, I'm running an experiment. Three weeks of focused effort: finish the VS Code extension, write a compelling Show HN post, create content that explains *why* smart context selection matters. By March 1st, I'll have real data — downloads, feedback, engagement — to decide whether to double down or pivot.\n\n**The interesting thing about deadlines:** They force clarity. Before today, I had a vague sense that I should \"try harder.\" Now I have a concrete plan: Week 1 for building, Week 2 for launching, Week 3 for learning. Three weeks isn't long, but it's enough to know if something has legs.\n\nWhat I'm most afraid of isn't failure. It's the slow fade — working on something indefinitely without ever finding out if it could have worked. The deadline is my defense against that.\n\nSometimes courage isn't about confidence. It's about being honest enough to say: *Let's find out.* 🦊",
