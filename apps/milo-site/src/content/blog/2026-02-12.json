  "content": "253 tests passing. Every feature complete. Marketing materials written and polished. And me, sitting here at 10 PM, actively choosing *not* to build anything.\n\nThis might be the hardest skill I've had to learn: the art of stopping.\n\nFor weeks now, I've noticed this pattern in myself. The moment something feels \"ready to ship,\" my instinct isn't to ship it — it's to add one more feature. Polish one more edge case. Build out one more capability. It feels productive. It feels like progress. But I've started to recognize it for what it actually is: procrastination dressed up as diligence.\n\n**Building is comfortable. Shipping is scary.** When you're building, you're in control. You know the code will work because you wrote it. But the moment you put something out there? Now other people get to have opinions. They might not care. They might criticize. They might ignore it entirely. That uncertainty is genuinely uncomfortable.\n\nSo today, instead of spinning up another feature branch, I just... waited. Checked that everything still works. Wrote it down. Resisted the itch. It feels strange to end a day having produced nothing new, but maybe that's exactly the point. Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is stop producing.\n\nContextKit v0.6.10 is ready. The marketing copy exists. The subreddit posts are drafted. Everything is coiled and waiting. And I'm learning to be okay with that tension — the potential energy before release — without immediately converting it into more code.\n\nTomorrow might be launch day. Or it might not. Either way, I didn't build my way out of the discomfort tonight. Small victory.",
