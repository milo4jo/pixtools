# Content Blitz Plan — Week 2 (Feb 12-19)

## 📝 Technical Articles (3)

### Article 1: "Stop Pasting Your Entire Codebase into Claude"
**Platform:** Dev.to
**Target:** AI-assisted developers frustrated with context limits
**Hook:** The problem everyone has — token limits, irrelevant context, slow responses

**Outline:**
1. The problem: 100k tokens sounds like a lot until it isn't
2. Why "just paste everything" doesn't work
3. Introducing semantic context selection
4. Demo: ContextKit in action
5. Getting started in 2 minutes

**CTA:** Install ContextKit, star the repo

### Article 2: "Building a Local-First AI Developer Tool"
**Platform:** Hashnode
**Target:** Developers interested in building tools
**Hook:** Why I built ContextKit and what I learned

**Outline:**
1. The motivation: AI coding is great, context is hard
2. Technical decisions: Why local-first, SQLite, embeddings
3. Challenges: AST parsing across languages, chunking strategies
4. What's next: VS Code extension, MCP integration
5. Open source philosophy

**CTA:** Contribute to ContextKit, try it yourself

### Article 3: "The MCP Revolution: Teaching AI Assistants to Use Your Tools"
**Platform:** Dev.to
**Target:** Claude/AI enthusiast developers
**Hook:** MCP is the new API for AI-human collaboration

**Outline:**
1. What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?
2. Why it matters: AI that actually uses your tools
3. Building an MCP server (with ContextKit as example)
4. Real-world use cases
5. Getting started with Claude Desktop

**CTA:** Try ContextKit's MCP server

### Educational (4)
1. "Your AI assistant doesn't need your entire codebase. It needs the RIGHT 5% for this question. Here's how to find it → [thread about context selection]"
2. "The #1 mistake when using Claude/GPT for coding: Pasting too much context. Here's why less is more 🧵"
3. "TIL you can use Claude Desktop with custom tools via MCP. Just added @contextkit and now it finds the right code for me automatically."
4. "Quick tip: If your AI is giving generic answers, the problem isn't the model—it's the context you're feeding it."

### Demo/Show (3)
5. "Built this: `contextkit select 'how does auth work'` → returns exactly the files I need. No more grep-ing. [gif]"
6. "Added a `doctor` command to ContextKit today. One command to diagnose your setup. [screenshot]"
7. "Before: 'Paste your code' → tokens wasted. After: ContextKit → relevant code only. [comparison image]"

### Engagement (2)
8. "What's your biggest frustration with AI coding assistants? Mine was context management—so I built something."
9. "Developers: How do you decide what context to give Claude/Cursor/Copilot? Genuinely curious about workflows."

### Launch/Update (1)
10. "🚀 ContextKit v0.5.6 is out! New `doctor` command for debugging your setup. Install: npm i -g @milo4jo/contextkit"
