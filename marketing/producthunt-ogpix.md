## 💬 First Comment (Maker Comment)

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built OGPix because I was tired of:
1. Making OG images manually for every blog post
2. Setting up complex image generation pipelines
3. Seeing ugly default link previews when I forget

OGPix is dead simple:

<meta property="og:image" content="https://ogpix.dev/api/og?title=My%20Post" />

One URL = one beautiful image. No build step, no dependencies.

We have 22 templates covering:
- Blog posts & articles
- GitHub repos & docs
- Product launches & features
- Events, podcasts, and more

Plus 21 themes from dark mode to neon gradients.

I'd love your feedback:
- What templates are missing?
- What customization options would you add?
- Any bugs?

Free tier gives you 100 images/month — plenty to try it out!

Thanks for checking it out! 🦊
