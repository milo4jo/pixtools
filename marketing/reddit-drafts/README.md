# Reddit Community Seeding - Week 3 (Feb 12-18)

## Overview

These are draft posts for ContextKit community seeding. Goal: genuine engagement, not spammy promotion.

## Posting Schedule

| Day | Subreddit | Post | Best Time |
|-----|-----------|------|-----------|
| Wed Feb 12 | r/programming | Technical overview | 9am EST |
| Thu Feb 13 | r/node | Node-focused angle | 10am EST |
| Fri Feb 14 | r/webdev | Webdev workflow | 9am EST |
| Mon Feb 17 | r/ChatGPT | User pain point focus | 11am EST |
| Tue Feb 18 | r/LocalLLaMA | Local-first angle | 10am EST |

## Guidelines

1. **Be genuine** - Share the real pain point that led to building this
2. **Engage quickly** - First 2 hours are crucial for visibility
3. **Accept criticism** - Some people will be skeptical, that's fine
4. **No defensive replies** - Thank people for feedback, even negative
5. **Follow up** - Check each post for 24-48 hours

## Before Posting

- [ ] Verify links work (GitHub, npm)
- [ ] Have quick fixes ready for any bugs people find
- [ ] Prepare follow-up comments with more detail
- [ ] Check subreddit rules for self-promotion
